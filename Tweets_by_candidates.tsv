.@realDonaldTrump wants people like AG Sessions ‚Äì a loyalist who lied to the Senate about meeting with the Russians ‚Äì in @TheJusticeDept.	Elizabeth_Warren
.@realDonaldTrump fired acting AG Sally Yates ‚Äì who refused to defend his #MuslimBan &amp; had warned the WH about Flynn‚Äôs contact with Russia.	Elizabeth_Warren
GOP &amp; Dems respect Preet Bharara as a fearless prosecutor who stands up to both parties &amp; Wall Street. I guess that's why Trump fired him.	Elizabeth_Warren
Preet Bharara had authority over Trump Tower. @realDonaldTrump called him directly, breaching protocol. 24 hrs later he was asked to resign.	Elizabeth_Warren
Weeks ago, @realDonaldTrump promised to keep Preet Bharara as the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan. Yesterday, Preet was fired. Why?	Elizabeth_Warren
.@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about getting corruption out of gov. But he wants a bunch of tame prosecutors who won‚Äôt investigate him.	Elizabeth_Warren
It‚Äôs time to junk this cruel #Trumpcare bill before massive numbers of Americans are hurt by it.	Elizabeth_Warren
A health care bill that destroys care &amp; affordable coverage for millions ‚Äì seriously? What planet are these guys living on?!	Elizabeth_Warren
Republicans seem intent on plowing ahead anyway ‚Äì pretending down is up, left is right, &amp; #Trumpcare is somehow not a catastrophe.	Elizabeth_Warren
Don‚Äôt forget patient advocates like @ACSCAN &amp; @AARPadvocates ‚Äì they‚Äôre appalled by #Trumpcare, too.	Elizabeth_Warren
The GOP have convinced people who never agree on ANYTHING ‚Äì docs, hospitals, economists, even insurance companies: #Trumpcare is a disaster.	Elizabeth_Warren

I‚Äôm heading to the Senate floor now to speak out against GOP‚Äôs plan to repeal the Fair Pay &amp; Safe Workplaces order: https://t.co/dzZQbTR3Rg	Elizabeth_Warren
There‚Äôs a lot we could be doing to help US workers. Instead, the GOP wants to make it easier for giant gov contractors to hurt workers.	Elizabeth_Warren
Today‚Äôs debate on the Fair Pay &amp; Safe Workplaces order is about who Congress works for. I‚Äôm here to fight for workers ‚Äì &amp; I‚Äôll be voting no.	Elizabeth_Warren
Instead of helping workers, the GOP will vote today to make it easier for companies that hurt workers to get massive gov contracts.	Elizabeth_Warren
My office released a report today that shows 2/3 of the top contractors have been caught breaking labor laws. https://t.co/AOed3xBPYa	Elizabeth_Warren
The US gov pays billions to federal contractors ‚Äì but some of the biggest corporations underpay workers &amp; put their health/safety at risk.	Elizabeth_Warren
Read the article @ChuckGrassley &amp; I wrote about our over-the-counter hearing aid bill in @JAMAInternalMed: https://t.co/WXRhQlTiHz	Elizabeth_Warren

When we‚Äôre #fightingforfamilies loud enough person-to-person, city-to-city, state-to-state, then DC can‚Äôt ignore these issues any longer.	Elizabeth_Warren
And while the GOP continues to block #equalpay for equal work, state lawmakers are #fightingforfamilies.	Elizabeth_Warren
Businesses that cheat their workers must be held accountable. State lawmakers are #fightingforfamilies with bills to stop wage theft.	Elizabeth_Warren
A hard day‚Äôs work deserves a fair day‚Äôs pay. State lawmakers across the country are #fightingforfamilies with bills to expand overtime.	Elizabeth_Warren
And Massachusetts continues to lead the way in #fightingforfamilies with earned sick time &amp; the highest state minimum wage in the country.	Elizabeth_Warren
Massachusetts has shown that #fightingforfamilies can start in states. We did it with marriage equality &amp; health care reform.	Elizabeth_Warren
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; the GOP leadership aren‚Äôt #fightingforfamilies with policies like raising the min wage, overtime pay or fair scheduling.	Elizabeth_Warren
And we need Attorney General Jeff Sessions ‚Äì who should have never been confirmed in the first place ‚Äì to resign. We need it now.	Elizabeth_Warren
We need a special prosecutor totally independent of the AG. We need a real, bipartisan, transparent Congressional investigation into Russia.	Elizabeth_Warren
This is not normal. This is not fake news. This is a very real &amp; serious threat to the national security of the United States.	Elizabeth_Warren
Now Jeff Sessions is AG ‚Äì the final say on the law enforcement investigation into ties between the Trump campaign &amp; Russia? What a farce.	Elizabeth_Warren
Jeff Sessions answered ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Turns out he met with the Russian Ambassador. Two months before the election.	Elizabeth_Warren
It's a simple q: "Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election?"	Elizabeth_Warren
I'd like for you to meet my guest to the #Jointsession speech tonight: @UMassD student &amp; Iraqi refugee Tiba Faraj. https://t.co/vrkbsok6ej	Elizabeth_Warren
I can name a zillion reasons why MA is the best ‚Äì but our schools &amp; health care are two very good reasons. Go MA! https://t.co/U0LtDPgwSO	Elizabeth_Warren
For any and all these reasons, today I urged my colleagues to vote NO on Wilbur Ross for @CommerceGov. https://t.co/n5KKjRI5ps	Elizabeth_Warren
Wilbur Ross has shady ties to Russia, serious business conflicts, &amp; a history of cheating people out of their homes.	Elizabeth_Warren
.@CommerceGov nominee Wilbur Ross is practically a cartoon stereotype of a Wall Street fat cat with no interest in anyone but himself.	Elizabeth_Warren
.@SenMarkey &amp; I wrote to 17 agencies about whether they‚Äôll use Trump‚Äôs order to cut off funding for MA services. https://t.co/fPboLE9Pqu	Elizabeth_Warren
MA pays more in taxes than we get back in federal funds. But that money is at risk because of @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs order on local immigrants.	Elizabeth_Warren
Heading to the Senate floor now to urge my colleagues to reject Wilbur Ross‚Äôs nomination for @CommerceGov. Watch: https://t.co/etvzEJEk7W	Elizabeth_Warren
Every R who opposes extending debate today is responsible for whatever it turns out is in Pruitt's emails next week. Make the right choice.	Elizabeth_Warren
Considering how obsessed @GOP are with emails, I'd hope they'd vote to extend debate on Pruitt until we can see his secret Big Oil ones.	Elizabeth_Warren
.@SenateGOP are jamming through Pruitt at @EPA before his emails come out. At 12:30pm, @SenateDems will force a vote to extend the debate.	Elizabeth_Warren
.@EPA nominee Scott Pruitt wouldn't provide his office's records of dealings with Big Oil, so a court ruled he must release them next week.	Elizabeth_Warren
I‚Äôm speaking on the Senate floor now to strong oppose Scott Pruitt to run the @EPA. Watch: https://t.co/mWLpJbotzx	Elizabeth_Warren
In the choice between corporate polluters &amp; people who want to breathe the air &amp; drink the water, Scott Pruitt sides with the polluters.	Elizabeth_Warren
Those emails might show corruption - so of course Republicans are jamming his confirmation through 4 days before the emails become public.	Elizabeth_Warren
A few hours ago, a judge in OK ordered the release of thousands of emails on @EPA nominee Scott Pruitt's relationship with Big Oil.	Elizabeth_Warren

And on Monday, I sent Andy Puzder 28 pages of questions about his readiness to protect America‚Äôs workers. https://t.co/FKuf9NgpvX	Elizabeth_Warren
We detailed more stories from Andy Puzder‚Äôs mistreated workers in a report two weeks ago: https://t.co/heeSO53zOx	Elizabeth_Warren
We heard the stories of workers mistreated by Andy Puzder‚Äôs burger chains at a @SenateDems forum last month: https://t.co/5MUt6XakXn	Elizabeth_Warren
.@realDonaldTrump ‚Äôs nominee for @USDOL - @CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees CEO Andy Puzder ‚Äì has made his fortune treating workers with total contempt.	Elizabeth_Warren
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP should stop these reckless actions to hurt the ACA before they hurt even more people who need health coverage.	Elizabeth_Warren
When you shut down ads, fewer people sign up. Now Humana is pulling out of the exchanges. They don‚Äôt have enough healthy young ppl enrolled.	Elizabeth_Warren
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP have worked around the clock to sabotage health care: A vague ACA order. Repeal &amp; run. Pull the enrollment ads.	Elizabeth_Warren
Congress must pull its head out of the sand and launch a real, bipartisan, transparent inquiry into Russia. Our natl security is at stake.	Elizabeth_Warren
When did @WhiteHouse know that Flynn lied? What other contacts with Russia occurred during the campaign? Who knew what? Who approved what?	Elizabeth_Warren
This. Is. Not. Normal. @realDonaldTrump owes Americans a full account of his Admin‚Äôs dealings with Russia, both before &amp; after the election.	Elizabeth_Warren
.@realDonaldTrump is still making money overseas &amp; may have financial ties to Russia. Nobody knows since he STILL won‚Äôt release his taxes.	Elizabeth_Warren
.@StateDept Sec Rex Tillerson has close ties to Putin. @CommerceGov nominee Wilbur Ross has close financial ties to Putin buddies.	Elizabeth_Warren
Reports say our own intel agencies have corroborated parts of a dossier alleging that Russia has compromising info about @realDonaldTrump.	Elizabeth_Warren
This isn‚Äôt a game. Reports say the Russians conducted a series of successful cyber-attacks on our elections to help elect @realDonaldTrump.	Elizabeth_Warren
But American national security demands that we not allow Michael Flynn to become a scapegoat for this Admin's disturbing ties to Russia.	Elizabeth_Warren
Michael Flynn‚Äôs blinding religious hatred &amp; shady Russian ties disqualified him as NSA on day one. His removal is a win for American values.	Elizabeth_Warren
I will be voting NO on Steve Mnuchin‚Äôs confirmation for @USTreasury tonight. I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.	Elizabeth_Warren
If Wall Street threatens to blow up the economy again, does anyone seriously expect Steve Mnuchin to tell his buddies to knock it off?	Elizabeth_Warren
Personnel is policy. Hiring Mnuchin &amp; all these @GoldmanSachs execs shows @realDonaldTrump has no interest in reducing Wall St‚Äôs influence.	Elizabeth_Warren
.@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about Wall St - but he's hired enough @GoldmanSachs alums to open a new bank branch at the @WhiteHouse.	Elizabeth_Warren

And you better believe every Senator who voted to put Jeff Sessions‚Äôs radical hatred into @TheJusticeDept will hear from all of us, too.	Elizabeth_Warren
If Jeff Sessions makes even the tiniest attempt to bring his racism, sexism &amp; bigotry into @TheJusticeDept, he'll hear from all of us.	Elizabeth_Warren
If Jeff Sessions turns a blind eye while @realDonaldTrump violates the Constitution or breaks the law, he'll hear from all of us.	Elizabeth_Warren
There‚Äôs no Rule 19 to silence me from talking about Jeff Sessions anymore. So let me say loudly &amp; clearly: This is just the beginning.	Elizabeth_Warren
Thanks to you, everyone now knows the concerns that Coretta Scott King had about Jeff Sessions. Concerns that millions of people still have.	Elizabeth_Warren
